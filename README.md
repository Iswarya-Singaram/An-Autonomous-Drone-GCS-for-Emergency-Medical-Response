# An Autonomous Drone GCS for Emergency Medical Response

A web-based Ground Control Station (GCS) designed to dispatch a reconnaissance drone as a first responder to accident scenes, providing medical professionals with "eyes on the scene" for remote triage before an ambulance arrives.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üåê Web-Based GCS:** A fully responsive and platform-independent interface accessible from any device with a web browser.
-   **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Mission Planning:** Simply click on a map to set the patient's location and automatically generate an intelligent flight path along road networks.
-   **üìπ Live Video Streaming:** A low-latency video feed from the drone's onboard camera for real-time patient assessment.
-   **üìä Real-Time Telemetry:** Live data streaming via WebSockets for critical flight information (altitude, speed, battery, GPS).
-   **üîí Robust Safety Features:** Essential controls like **Arm**, **Disarm**, and **Return to Launch (RTL)** for complete operator control.
-   **üõ∞Ô∏è Onboard Intelligence:** The entire system is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4 mounted on the drone, creating a self-contained unit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Setup & Pin Connections

### 1. Pixhawk to Raspberry Pi Connection

This serial connection is the communication link between the flight controller and the onboard computer.

| Pixhawk (TELEM2) | Signal  | Raspberry Pi (GPIO) | Physical Pin # |
| :--------------- | :------ | :------------------ | :------------- |
| Pin 2 (TX)       | Transmit| GPIO 15 (RXD)       | Pin 10         |
| Pin 3 (RX)       | Receive | GPIO 14 (TXD)       | Pin 8          |
| Pin 6 (GND)      | Ground  | Ground              | Pin 6          |

### 2. Power System (Buck Converter)

A buck converter (LM2596) is used to step down the drone's battery voltage to provide a stable 5V to the Raspberry Pi.

| Source              | Buck Converter | Destination                  |
| :------------------ | :------------- | :--------------------------- |
| PDB VCC (Battery +) | IN+            | -                            |
| PDB GND (Battery -) | IN-            | -                            |
| -                   | OUT+           | Raspberry Pi 5V (Pin 2 or 4) |
| -                   | OUT-           | Raspberry Pi GND (Pin 6)     |
